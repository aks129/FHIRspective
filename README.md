# Fhirspective: FHIR-Powered Data Quality Assessment Tool

**Fhirspective** is a healthcare data quality assessment platform built on HL7 FHIR standards. It enables data aggregators, payers, providers, and health IT vendors to measure, monitor, and improve the trustworthiness of healthcare data using modern, standards-aligned, and AI-augmented approaches.

## 🚀 Why Fhirspective?

Most healthcare data quality tools focus on format and completeness. Fhirspective goes further:

* Aligns with **FHIR R4/R5** and **US Core** profiles
* Supports **TDQM**, **DMBOK**, and **ISO 8000** principles
* Incorporates **AI/ML** models for intelligent anomaly detection
* Enables **role-specific rubrics** and scoring (payer, provider, aggregator)
* Tracks **data quality over time** with historical benchmarking
* Offers **explainable assessments** to support human adjudication

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Ingest FHIR Bundles** (R4/R5)
2. **Profile against selected Implementation Guides** (e.g., US Core)
3. **Run Quality Checks** (rule engine + AI analysis)
4. **Generate Quality Scorecard + Rubric**
5. **Expose via API or UI**

## 📦 Installation

> Coming soon — will support Docker, CLI, and hosted options.

## 📍 Roadmap

* [ ] Support for FHIR Subscriptions to monitor incoming streams
* [ ] Rule authoring UI
* [ ] Integration with Spark pipelines
* [ ] Slack + JIRA alerts for failed quality checks
* [ ] Plug-in support for external quality benchmarks

## 🧠 Philosophy

We believe **Data Quality is a product**, not just a pipeline step.
Fhirspective is built to be:

* **Transparent** — you should know *why* a data issue was flagged
* **Role-aware** — different users need different definitions of “good data”
* **Evolvable** — new rules, profiles, and standards can be easily added
* **Interoperable** — open APIs, FHIR-aligned outputs, and pluggable models
